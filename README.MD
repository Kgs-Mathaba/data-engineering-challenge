For this challenge we are going to run a couple of hypothetical scenarios. Each scenario mirrors the types of responsibilities you would assume for the position within our team.

The position includes:
* A data labelling component. You will be expected to review and assess the usability of the data processed by our labelling team. Your assessments must guide the team to labelling the data with increasing accuracy and decreasing error. These assessments will always include a qualitative and quantitative component, which must be backed up with statistics.
* A data generation component. In addition to the standard image augmentation operations we produce our own in house algorithms to create synthetic data. Your responsibilities would include implementing and testing these algorithms and their outputs.
* A data management component. After all the data labelling and generation is done there is always a tonne of data to store and curate. Data, processed and unprocessed, must be easily accessible, referenceable and backed up on the cloud.

# Data Labelling - Labeller Assessment
To asses the quality of the annotations, I have created annotations of my own. I then compare them with the given annotations using the script 

# Data Generation - Working with Images

# Data Management - Combining images
